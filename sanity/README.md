# Sanity Content Studio

This is a Sanity Content Studio instance that serves as the data source for the To Not Do list application in this monorepo.

If you are trying to clone this repo and run the studio from here, it likely won't work. My suggestion to you is to do the following:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Save a copy of `schemas/schema.js`.
3. Delete the `sanity` directory.
4. Go through the process of [bootstrapping your own project](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli).
5. Add the `schema.js` file to your bootstrapped project.
